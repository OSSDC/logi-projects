  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Security:42 - Your software subscription period has lapsed. Your current
version of Xilinx tools will continue to function, but you no longer qualify for
Xilinx software updates or new releases.
WARNING:Pack:1653 - At least one timing constraint is impossible to meet because component delays alone exceed the constraint. A timing
   constraint summary below shows the failing constraints (preceded with an Asterisk (*)). Please use the Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE
   (command line) with the Mapped NCD and PCF files to identify which constraints and paths are failing because of the component delays
   alone. If the failing path(s) is mapped to Xilinx components as expected, consider relaxing the constraint. If it is not mapped to
   components as expected, re-evaluate your HDL and how synthesis is optimizing the path. To allow the tools to bypass this error, set the
   environment variable XIL_TIMING_ALLOW_IMPOSSIBLE to 1.


   For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing Analyzer Reference manual; for more information on TRCE,
   consult the Xilinx Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
WARNING:Place:1206 - This design contains a global buffer instance,
   <sys_clocks_gen/clkout2_buf>, driving the net, <PMOD2_3_OBUF>, that is
   driving the following (first 30) non-clock load pins off chip.
   < PIN: PMOD2<3>.O; >
   This design practice, in Spartan-6, can lead to an unroutable situation due
   to limitations in the global routing. If the design does route there may be
   excessive delay or skew on this net. It is recommended to use a Clock
   Forwarding technique to create a reliable and repeatable low skew solution:
   instantiate an ODDR2 component; tie the .D0 pin to Logic1; tie the .D1 pin to
   Logic0; tie the clock net to be forwarded to .C0; tie the inverted clock to
   .C1. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was
   applied on COMP.PIN <sys_clocks_gen/clkout2_buf.O> allowing your design to
   continue. This constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the
   specified COMP.PIN.
WARNING:Place:1137 - This design is not guaranteed to be routable! This design
   contains a global buffer instance, <sys_clocks_gen/clkout2_buf>, driving the
   net, <PMOD2_3_OBUF>, that is driving the following (first 30) non-clock load
   pins.
   < PIN: PMOD2<3>.O; >
   This is not a recommended design practice in Spartan-6 due to limitations in
   the global routing that may cause excessive delay, skew or unroutable
   situations.  It is recommended to only use a BUFG resource to drive clock
   loads. Please pay extra attention to the timing and routing of this path to
   ensure the design goals are met. This is normally an ERROR but the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN
   <sys_clocks_gen/clkout2_buf.O> allowing your design to continue. This
   constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN.
WARNING:Place:1109 - A clock IOB / BUFGMUX clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGMUX site pair. The clock
   IOB component <GPMC_CLK> is placed at site <P105>. The corresponding BUFG
   component <GPMC_CLK_BUFGP/BUFG> is placed at site <BUFGMUX_X2Y9>. There is
   only a select set of IOBs that can use the fast path to the Clocker buffer,
   and they are not being used. You may want to analyze why this problem exists
   and correct it. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE
   constraint was applied on COMP.PIN <GPMC_CLK.PAD> allowing your design to
   continue. This constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the
   specified COMP.PIN. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may
   lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition
   be corrected in the design.
WARNING:Place:1109 - A clock IOB / BUFGMUX clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGMUX site pair. The clock
   IOB component <PMOD2<7>> is placed at site <P57>. The corresponding BUFG
   component <PMOD2_7_BUFGP/BUFG> is placed at site <BUFGMUX_X3Y5>. There is
   only a select set of IOBs that can use the fast path to the Clocker buffer,
   and they are not being used. You may want to analyze why this problem exists
   and correct it. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE
   constraint was applied on COMP.PIN <PMOD2<7>.PAD> allowing your design to
   continue. This constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the
   specified COMP.PIN. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may
   lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition
   be corrected in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2410 - This design is using one or more 9K Block RAMs
   (RAMB8BWER).  9K Block RAM initialization data, both user defined and
   default, may be incorrect and should not be used.  For more information,
   please reference Xilinx Answer Record 39999.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   1 block(s) removed
   2 block(s) optimized away
   1 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Loadless block "sys_clocks_gen/clkout3_buf" (CKBUF) removed.
 The signal "sys_clocks_gen/clkout2" is loadless and has been removed.

Optimized Block(s):
TYPE 		BLOCK
GND 		XST_GND
VCC 		XST_VCC

To enable printing of redundant blocks removed and signals merged, set the
detailed map report option and rerun map.

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
